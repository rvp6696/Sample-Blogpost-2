                Pure.css is an incredibly lightweight CSS library. The <label class="high"> entire library clocks in at
                </label> only 4.0kb, when its zipped. Despite its small size, Pure.css offers a complete suite of CSS
                tools. It has CSS tools for everything from tables to buttons to grids and forms. As seen below, a
                default inline form is created by adding the class name pure-form to any form element.

                Ian is the one everyone is watching, it is expected to rapidly strengthen by the start of next week, and
                then around Wednesday-Thursday, make landfall in Florida, it is too far out to say how strong Ian will
                be by then, but it currently forecasted to be near Major Hurricane strength at landfall Thursday
                morning. Gaston and Hermine, well not too much to talk about, Gaston brought Tropical Storm force winds
                to the Azores, Gaston is expected to be Post-tropical by tonight, while Hermine is bringing heavy rain
                to the Canary Islands, it is expected to weaken by tonight and become post-tropical by Sunday.
